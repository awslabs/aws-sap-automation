# AWS SDK for SAP ABAP download and import

Downloads, unpacks and copies the AWS SDK for SAP ABAP's transport files to their designated location for further processing.
The script is further able to add all transport files to the SAP system's transport buffer and import the ABAP SDK's core
transport. Additional transports can be imported as needed. For brand new installations, the script can generate a minimal 
transport profile, so that all transports are readily available after setting up transaction STMS. 

## Prerequisites (Once only)

- Check the top of the script if the download URLs and public key are still current (see [ABAP SDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-sapabap/latest/developer-guide/installation.html))
- Create and attach the provided [IAM Policy](iam_policy.json) to role **AmazonEC2RoleForLaunchWizard**

## New LW4SAP deployments:

In AWS Launch Wizard for SAP, proceed to **Configure deployment model**. 
In section **Post-deployment configuration script**, choose the following Amazon S3 URL as script location.:

```bash
s3://aws-sap-automation/tagging/run.sh
```

In case of a distributed deployment, choose **ASCS/SCS/PAS** AND **AAS** as target server. 

The result looks as follows, the error message "Invalid S3 Bucket" can be ignored:

Click 'next' to complete the wizard.

## Existing LW4SAP deployments:

Navigate to AWS Systems Manager â†’ Documents and hit **Create document**. Choose a name and copy and paste the following Content

```yml
description: ''
schemaVersion: '2.2'
mainSteps:
- action: aws:runShellScript
  name: 'RunTagging'
  inputs:
    runCommand:
    - aws s3 cp s3://aws-sap-automation/abapsdk-download-install/run.sh ./ --region eu-central-1
    - chmod +x run.sh
    - ./run.sh
```

To save, press **Create document**.  

Next, locate your document and press **Run command**. Select your target EC2 instances and press **Run**.

Wait until the command has completed successfully. In case the command failed, check the command output/error directly for more information!

## Troubleshooting

- Check [Launch Wizard Post-deployment script Log](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/launchwizard/latest/userguide/launch-wizard-sap-troubleshooting.html#launch-wizard-sap-troubleshooting-scripts)

## Considerations

- The script comes with two runmodes, "lwpostscript" for post-script deployment with the AWS Launch Wizard for SAP and "standalone" for use with already fully operating SAP systems
- Currently, all ABAP SDK transports are added to the SAP system's transport queue, which means 350+ individual transports
- If available, an existing transport profile can be provided in both modes (highly recommended for "standalone" mode)
- The ABAP SDK core transport is imported into client 000 by default, an alternative client can be passed via commandline (standalone mode)
- Transports are imported with **Ignore Invalid Component Version** and **Overwrite Originals** options set
- Once executed successfully, you may cleanup the artifacts in directory **/tmp/aws-sap-automation**
